Download files for port 22 (SSH) or 3306 (MySQL) for each month from [here](https://opendata.rapid7.com/sonar.cio/).
They will be in the bz2 file format, unpack them using suitable software (such as the Ubuntu archive manager).
Place them in the raw_data folder and parse them by running parse_data_numpy. You can either parse all port 22 files, 
all 3306 files or both. Please adjust parse_data_numpy accordingly.
Afterwards, call one of the files in the software folder to calculate the MDP and number of users of that software.
